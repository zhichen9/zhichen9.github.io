I am a M.S. student in Management Science and Engineering at the School of Economic Management, Tongji University. Iâ€™m fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor Zhang.

I am interested in research fields such as game theory and behavioral operations, and am currently doing related research. In the future, I also want to do some empirical research.

I like traveling, walking around the city, seeing different scenery and appreciating different cultures. I usually do some sports, such as basketball, badminton, cycling, etc.
